MSU - Homework 17: Fitness Tracker (NoSQL)

## Overview
For this project I created a workout tracker. A Mongo database was created with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

Overall, the goal is to help the consumer reach their fitness goals more quickly by tracking their workout progress.

The user can do the following:
* View, create, and track daily workouts.
* Log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.
* Track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.
* Track the distance traveled of cardio exercise.
